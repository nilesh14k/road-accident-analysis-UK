# Ananlysis on road accident - United Kingdom
The aim of this coursework is to communicate findings from the analysis of Road Safety Data for
England in 2019. The report has three objectives it explores in terms of casualties, including Killed or
#### Seriously Injured Casualties (KSI):
1. Patterns in the demographics of casualties
2. Patterns between local authorities of KSI accidents
3. Patterns in KSI pedestrians

#### The analysis works with two datasets:
1. Road Safety 2019 Casualty Data: dft-road-casualty-statistics-casualties-2019
2. Road Safety 2019 Accidents Data: dft-road-casualty-statistics-accidents-2019

### Conclusions
Several interesting patterns were observed in the two datasets. After analysing the demographics of
casualties, uneven sex ratios were discovered in different casualty classes. Majority of the driver or rider
casualties were males (about 67%) while almost 60% of passenger casualties were females. Motorcycle
and cycle casualties are mostly males(85%), whereas casualties caused due to horse riding and public
transport are majorly females (62%). Coming to local authorities, the five local authorities with the most
KSI accidents were Birmingham, Cornwall, Leeds, Sheffield, and Westminster. They made up 7.17% of
total accidents. It was observed that more accidents occurred on weekends than weekdays. Additionally,
more than 90% of accidents happen on highways as opposed to streets, and two-thirds of incidents
occur in dry circumstances. The majority of accidents happen at unmonitored junctions.
Pedestrians who were killed or seriously injured accounted for 6,200 of the total killed or seriously injured
casualties. Pedestrian casualties constitute a higher percentage (87%) in urban areas than in small
towns and rural areas. Senior citizens aged between 70-80 years old accounted for half the pedestrian
fatalities. Analysis shows that 69% of the pedestrian accidents happened in dry road surface conditions
while 30% happened in wet or damp road surface conditions. There was also no physical crossing
facility within 50 miles for 62% of the pedestrian accidents.
